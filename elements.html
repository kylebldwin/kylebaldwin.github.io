										<h2 id="content">Project Idea</h2>
										<p>My project idea would be a mobile application that shows all the nightclubs and bars in your area (sort of like google maps). I chose to make it a mobile application as opposed to a different platform such as a website as I believe that it would be more practical to have this application on the go, so for example, if an individual or a group of people were in the city without a set plan and they are looking for a place to drink at, they could quickly check their phone to see a place that suits their requirements.<br><br>I think that this would be a good mobile application as most nightclubs rent out a specific venue for a night (eg. Treat Nightclub rents out a place called "The Bottom End" on Saturday nights) so if someone were to search up the nightclub on google maps it would have the name of the venue, not the nightclub and it can cause some confusion, which I have personally been a victim of in the past. Currently, all nightclubs only really have Facebook pages as a platform to advertise themselves on, and  although it is decent at advertising events through the Facebook event feature, my application will aim to improve it to make advertisement easier for the businesses.<br><br>The main screen of the application will be a google maps type display, showing the streets of your surrounding area, with special markers for bars and nightclubs (bars and nightclubs will each have unique markers making it easier to see which one it is). Additionally, it will feature a simple search bar for when a user of the application is searching for a specific venue, but doesn't know where it is. By doing this, it will save them the time and effort of looking around the maps and checking each individual business for the one they want. When you click on a certain nightclub, it will show you specific details such as what DJs are performing on that night, opening hours, ways of getting cheaper entry (eg. Free entry before a certain time) and drink specials for that night. It will also incorporate a feature similar to TripAdvisor showing a range of 1 to 3 dollar signs to show how much money people spend there on average to help people make a decision (helpful for university students with a low budget for the night). It will feature an optional notification feature, showing pop-up notifications on mobile devices for special events that may be running at a particular bar or club on that given night. There will be an option for owners of a particular bar or club that isn't on the app database yet to add their business. This will obviously have a authentication feature meaning that an admin of the application will have to manually confirm that it is a legitimate business and that it isn't just a random place being added by internet trolls. Users of the app will also be able to rate the places they have been to similar to google reviews and TripAdvisor, to give other users an indication of what their experience would be like if they were to visit that same place. Although it may be slightly difficult, it would ideally feature an age range of the visitors of the place as some places are more suited for teenagers and young adults (18-21), whereas other places may be more suited for people a little older (24-30). The application will not show any bottle shops on the map as I feel that they can already be easily found through google maps.<br><br>The application would obviously require a mobile device to be run on as well as a Wi-Fi connection to actually run as it would need to gather the current location of the user and display all the surrounding bars and clubs. In order to actually create the mobile app, the use of some programming language would be required.<br><br>The application would require a lot of mobile development and programming skills to be successfully created. With my lack of skills surrounding the requirements of this given task, it is a very feasible and realistic idea that could be executed by an experienced programmer and/or app developer. As I don't have the money to hire such people, nor do I know anyone that would do it for free, it would be hard to get this made under my jurisdiction.<br><br>The app would be great for users who are looking for a place to hang out with their friends without putting in too much effort to actually find a place. It would vastly improve the current issues with nightclubs of renting out a specific venue of a different name, and businesses only having Facebook as a platform to advertise their place. It is a simple, yet very effective app that would greatly improve a night out for many party goers and casual drinkers. </p>
