										<h2>Ideal Job - IT Lecturer</h2>
									</header>

									<span class=""><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>A position at RMIT University to teach and educate students studying Business Information Systems in either an undergraduate or masters course. <br>The position appeals to me as I would love to teach what I am passionate about in the future and I have gotten some inspiration from my father who is a lecturer for Computer Science at The University of Melbourne. <br> The position requires a lot of qualifications which will take a very long time to get such as a PhD in the given subject as well as prior teaching at an Australian university within a given timeframe of 3 years.<br>I am definitely unqualified for this job at the moment, as I am certain that I wouldn’t be able to teach the subject and in addition, not only do I not have a PhD, I haven’t even finished the first year of my bachelors degree.<br>I will obtain these qualifications by studying hard and completing my degree and eventually work my way up to a PhD which may take me many years.

									<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
									<p><b>Personality:</b> Entertainer <br><b>Learning Style:</b> Auditory/Tactile
									<p><br><b>Myers-Briggs Test Results:</b> 78% extraverted, 62% observant, 88% feeling, 56% prospecting, 57% assertive<br><b>Big 5 Personality Test:</b> 88% extroversion, 70% emotional stability, 80% agreeableness, 31% conscientious, 60% intellect/imagination
									<p>These results show me that I am a very extroverted person, meaning that I am very outgoing and love social interaction. I personally agree with these results as I personally hate spending a night in by myself when I could hang out with some friends. Most of my other results I agree with as well
									<p>Because I am quite outgoing and friendly, I think I would get along with anyone that I am paired up with as I would also understand if people are quiet and shy and wouldn't pressure them into speaking or make them uncomfortable. I believe that I would share my thoughts on a project as much as possible.
									<p>I would personally look to form teams with more extroverted people, as I would prefer to work with people who aren't afraid to share their thoughts and ideas and we wouldn't have any issues getting along. It also means that the conversations and ideas would keep flowing and would be a very smooth and stress free group project.
