												<h3>My interest in IT</h3>
												<p>I decided to study an IT degree as I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do with my life, but at the same time I didn't want to wait to figure out what that was so I decided that this course would be a good starting point for deciding what I want to do in the future. Last year, as part of my VCE studies, I studied software development where I used visual basic for my assessments and although I got a pretty horrible study score, I still enjoyed the subject in parts.</p>

												<h3>Why I chose RMIT</h3>
												<p>I chose to come to RMIT because I didn't get an offer to study IT at Monash University, and decided that I would study and work really hard for a year and transfer to Monash. For the short time that I have been here, I have really appreciated the geographic location of the university campus, as it is right next to both Melbourne Central and the State Library, allowing me to have very easy access to food and a train station. The first few weeks of this course have made me realise that I don't want to do an IT course any more so I will use this year or semester to try and figure out what I want to do.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>What I expect to learn</h3>
												<p>I have absolutely no idea what to expect from my studies as I didn't really put any time into researching the course outline as it was a last minute decision for me to study IT at RMIT. I am assuming that there will be parts of the course related to programming, but outside to that I have absolutely no idea what this course has to offer.</p>
